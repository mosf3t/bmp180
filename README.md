## About this Repository

The vast majority of the code in this repository is the work of Roman Shevchik. I have only made minor customisations for
my own convenience as I learn about microcontroller application development. If you find yourself looking around this 
repository, I strongly recommend you refer instead to Roman's excellent work which you can find at:
